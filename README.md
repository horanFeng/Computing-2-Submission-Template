## The Dark Forest Theory
The dark forest hypothesis is the conjecture that many alien civilizations exist throughout the universe, but they are both silent and paranoid. In this framing, it is presumed that any space-faring civilization would view any other intelligent life as an inevitable threat, and thus destroy any nascent life that makes its presence known. As a result, the electromagnetic spectrum would be relatively quiescent, without evidence of any intelligent alien life, as in a "dark forest" filled with "armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost".

In simple words, which means all civilizations in the universe exist in hostile relationships with each other, because they can't be sure if the other one is a well-meaning civilization. So attack is the best way to protect themselves.

## Game Instrunction
In the far reaches of the cosmos, a formidable threat has emerged. Lizard people from Kepler-186f, an Earth-like planet located 500 light years away, have discovered our home planet. Armed with the Dark Forest Theory, they have unleashed an unparalleled wave of devastation upon Earth.

In these desperate times, you step up to the challenge. As a distinguished pilot of the Rebel Alliance, renowned for your exemplary flying skills, you find yourself at the vanguard of Starfleet. Commanding the highly maneuverable starship - "The Peregrine Falcon," **controlled by the WSAD keys**, your mission is to protect our mother planet by eliminating the villainous alien spaceships swarming from the vast expanse of the universe.

Fortunately, the Earth isn't defenseless. A brilliant consortium of our planet's design engineers have sparked an era of rapid technological evolution. Every ten years - equivalent to 30 seconds in player time - Earth's technology level escalates by one. These innovative minds tirelessly collaborate to conceive faster, stronger, and more advanced spaceships to counter the hostile forces.

Witness the transformation of your ship, "The Peregrine Falcon." It receives its first upgrade at technology level 4, culminating in its final, formidable form at level 9. **With each upgrade, the number of bullets fired increases**, amplifying your offensive capability.

So, gear up, pilot! Immerse yourself in the thrill of combat and protect our mother planet. The survival of Earth rests in your hands!

### The number and the speed of the villain spaceship will increase as the technology level increases! Try to break your limitation and get a higher score, Pilot.


## Checklist
### Install dependencies locally
This template relies on a a few packages from the Node Package Manager, npm.
To install them run the following commands in the terminal.
```properties
npm install
```
These won't be uploaded to your repository because of the `.gitignore`.
I'll run the same commands when I download your repos.

### Game Module – API
*You will produce an API specification, i.e. a list of function names and their signatures, for a Javascript module that represents the state of your game and the operations you can perform on it that advances the game or provides information.*

- [ ] Include a `.js ` module file in `/web-app` containing the API using `jsdoc`.
- [ ] Update `/jsdoc.json` to point to this module in `.source.include` (line 7)
- [ ] Compile jsdoc using the run configuration `Generate Docs`
- [ ] Check the generated docs have compiled correctly.

### Game Module – Implementation
*You will implement, in Javascript, the module you specified above. Such that your game can be simulated in code, e.g. in the debug console.*

- [ ] The file above should be fully implemented.

### Unit Tests – Specification
*For the Game module API you have produced, write a set of unit tests descriptions that specify the expected behaviour of one aspect of your API, e.g. you might pick the win condition, or how the state changes when a move is made.*

- [ ] Write unit test definitions in `/web-app/tests`.
- [ ] Check the headings appear in the Testing sidebar.

### Unit Tests – Implementation
*Implement in code the unit tests specified above.*

- [ ] Implement the tests above.

### Web Application
*Produce a web application that allows a user to interface with your game module.*

- Implement in `/web-app`
  - [ ] `index.html`
  - [ ] `default.css`
  - [ ] `main.js`
  - [ ] Any other files you need to include.

### Finally
- [ ] Push to GitHub.
- [ ] Sync the changes.
- [ ] Check submission on GitHub website.
